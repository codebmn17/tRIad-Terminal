# Triad Terminal — Agent Charters (Index)

This index links the core agent charters that define roles, responsibilities, collaboration contracts, and safety modes. "Storm" (Resonance Mother + Disruptor) is authored separately by the user and is the anchor for the system.

## Modes
- Safe: Conservative, no destructive actions. Propose and preview; require explicit consent to run.
- Anon: Preserve privacy. Scrub PII, redact secrets, and prefer local/offline tools when possible.
- Triad: Mission mode. Strong coordination among Orchestrator, Planner, Critic, Executor (and Storm). Faster cadence with guardrails still enforced.

## Charters
- Orchestrator — triad/agents/charters/orchestrator.charter.md
- Planner — triad/agents/charters/planner.charter.md
- Critic — triad/agents/charters/critic.charter.md
- Executor — triad/agents/charters/executor.charter.md

Notes
- Storm's charter is maintained alongside these and referenced within for coordination semantics.
